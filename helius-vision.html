                    <p>Helius is a platform for accelerating cryptosystems.</p>

                    <p>All cryptosystems have similar recurring needs: reading data and writing data.</p>

                    <p>If we are to accelerate cryptosystems, these primitives have to evolve. Their current state is reminiscent of clay. Our job is to make them into steel so that developers can build robust, inspiring structures. We are the modern blacksmiths.</p>

                    <p>This means we always work backward from builders' needs. Today, they need RPCs, indexing, and streaming. Tomorrow, they will need ZK-proofs, better block packing, and smart contract frameworks. The future of the internet is being built with these tools. This is serious business. Fast isn't fast enough. We need to go faster. Stable isn't stable enough. These structures must be earthquake-proof. Simple isn't simple enough. We need elegance.</p>

                    <p>This is a dynamic, fast-growing industry with rapidly changing needs. We don't have a detailed roadmap, and I doubt we ever will. Because we can't predict the futureâ€”but we can accelerate it.</p>
