                    <p>the future is not predetermined</p>

                    <p>it is open and malleable to change because it depends on knowledge we have yet to create</p>

                    <p>(i.e., we don't know how to cure cancer, how to build quantum computers, or extend lifespan by 500 years)</p>

                    <p>and that new knowledge results in 2nd-order unpredictable effects which lead to more questions and consequently more opportunities for new knowledge creation</p>

                    <p>as a result, the set of all questions is unbounded, which means the set of opportunities to solve them is also unbounded</p>

                    <p>which means there are infinite new startups to create, more scientific discoveries to be made, and more progress to be had</p>

                    <p>the secrets are out there</p>

                    <p>and through challenging the status quo, thinking for yourself, being curious, and putting bold ideas forward to be tested â€” you have a chance to discover them</p>

                    <p>and this can only happen in a culture and society that encourages optimism and the marketplace of free expression and ideas</p>

                    <p>this is the case for freedom, the case for progress, and it's also the case for optimism</p>
